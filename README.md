Are you guys tired of all those forgotten console. log's everywhere on your project!!!
This piece of code can help you with that.
All you need to do:
Clone or Fork,
Save the file preferentially on the root of the project and call the function with the root directory path or any other folder that you might prefer.
The program will exclude the node modules or any other file that doesn't have ‘.js’ extension
